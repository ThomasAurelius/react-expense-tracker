## My process

### Built with

-  React
-  Material UI
-  Doughnut/chartjs-2
-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  CSS custom properties
-  Flexbox
-  CSS Grid
-  Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first project with Material-UI and I am still adjusting to its rules. Some of the grid sizing was less than intuitive at first..

### Continued development

I will continue to work on accessibility issues and improvements.
I want to add a database for the items, SSO google login auth, and a rolling two week subtotal in the income/expenses ledger.

### Useful resources

-  Video this build was based on: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnUFOWR_V4Y&t=8266s). I used this video for parts of the build, however I omitted the Speechly, and hosted on Vercel on my own instead of following the video.
